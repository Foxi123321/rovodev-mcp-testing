- **MCP Server Lifecycle**: Refined MCP server startup logic with improved logging clarity and better shutdown handling.
- **Tool Call Statistics**: Added comprehensive tool call evaluator and statistics tracking for better performance monitoring.
- **Max Retries Configuration**: Set max_retries on all toolsets for improved reliability and error handling.
- **Plan Reliability**: Enhanced deep plan reliability and CLI rendering with better error handling and user feedback.
