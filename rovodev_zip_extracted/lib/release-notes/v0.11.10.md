# Release Notes - v0.11.10

**Release Date:** August 21, 2025  
**Version:** 0.11.10

## Summary

This release focuses on improving the performance and reliability of the fuzzy file matching system, fixing chat handling bugs, and removing external dependencies for better stability.

## Bug Fixes

- **Initial Chat Handling**: Fixed bug in initial chat handling in the serve API where ChatRequest objects were not properly constructed
- **Fuzzy File Matching**: Improved performance and reliability by removing watchfiles dependency and implementing periodic cache refresh

## Engineering Improvements

- **Performance Optimization**: Replaced file watching with threading-based periodic refresh for fuzzy file matching, reducing latency and improving responsiveness
- **Dependency Reduction**: Removed watchfiles dependency to reduce external dependencies and improve stability
- **Code Architecture**: Refactored fuzzy file matcher to use non-singleton pattern for better testability and thread safety
- **Test Coverage**: Updated test suite to reflect new periodic refresh mechanism instead of file watching
